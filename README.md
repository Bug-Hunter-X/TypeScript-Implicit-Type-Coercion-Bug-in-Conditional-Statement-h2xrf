This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to implicit type coercion within conditional statements when comparing the results of functions. The bug is tricky to spot because the functions themselves work correctly, but unexpected behavior surfaces only in specific contexts. The solution provides a clear explanation and demonstrates how to avoid this issue by ensuring explicit type handling and comparisons.
